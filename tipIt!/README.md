Time spent on project: 15 Hours. 

# The run down.. what does the app do?

Required feature:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

Optional features that I thought were cool:
* [x] Bill amount is first responder
* [x] Field for rounding to dollar amount
* [x] Settings page
* [X] Option to hide/show roundTo
* [x] Not-so-easter-egg link to my github
* [x] Logic to reset the view when you type in roundTo or switch percentage
* [x] Using locale-specific currency. (This was easier than I thought)

Some things that I wish I would have done, given more time:
- split pay function
- default user segment in settings
- change colors based on system default
- settings page using tableview, however those are much different from regular view controllers, I wasted two hours trying to get it right, but alas. 
- Better design, definitely different fonts
- more acessibility features, like talk to text (acessibility is a HIGH priority) 


# Notes
Swift is a very interesting language. Some of it I understand, some I don't. In either case, trial and error, googling stuff, and stackoverflow got me through this
project. I'm glad that I did it and I hope I can take this class.
