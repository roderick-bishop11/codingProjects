           Hello! My name is Roderick Bishop, a Junior Computer Science Major also pursuing a minor in Robotics and Embodied Intelligence at South Carolina State University. On the outside, I am seen as a leader to the SCSU National Society of Black Engineers and Golden Key International Honour Society chapters, a technology and coding enthusiast to my peers, a teacher to students, and a distinguished student in the SCSU Honors College. While I am all of those things, I am also a person of great curiosity and a strong believer in growth and development and helping others.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have always been someone who seeks to extend past the boundaries of my educational degree and foray into unknown territory. Because of that, I have been able to develop a strong set of technical, leadership, and soft skills that I believe would prove to be an asset in any industry. Lastly, I am also someone who holds it votive to lend a helping hand to others. My caring heart is a big motivator for me and is why my career interests will always begin and end with others in mind, no matter the industry. In the future, I would love to apply my skills within the automotive, transportation, healthcare, and financial industries as well as public and non-profit sectors.
        </p>
