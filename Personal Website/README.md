## Project overview

This project is a self-led foray into the web-dev territory. My University does not offer courses on this topic currently but I still wanted to build a website, at least a static one
for the purposes of putting it on a business card and having another project under my belt. This project is bound to be a rough one, but I am certainly open to any comments or advice that
you guys have. Explore the repo, and let's hope I can do this right!

## Project steps
I thought it would be a great idea to plan out this project and break it down to smaller, easily doable steps: **be sure to check the [project kanban board](https://github.com/users/roderick-bishop11/projects/1) for progress on this project**

* Complete some research on easy websites for V1 of website. Things like technology stacks, architecture, beginner website examples, hosting, etc 
* Develop a few designs (paper drawings)
* Choose the design that best shows off your personality and will force you to learn to complete it 
* Create README outlining the overall goal of the project 
* Plan out the steps for the project 
* Further develop designs using design software. Indlude fonts, colors, assets, and possible animation details (hover, click, etc)(<-- we are here)
* Write out complete text for each web page in a document
* Mull over text on the document and refine (<-- but, we are also here....some things were revisited)
* Refresh HTML basics(tags, refs, divs, containers, links/buttons)
* Learn more advanced HTML concepts (are these even a thing)
* Implement functional menu bar and footer to website
* Add text to respective pages in HTML(all pages)
-- repeated for each section/page --
* Add all hrefs to assets in HTML
* Make sure that all text is in proper divs/containers/spans for use with CSS
* Refresh on CSS basics
* Learn some more advanced CSS design concepts/implementations
* Organize all text on the page according to the design
* Add font colors to all text
* Add background colors
* Add animations to assets, text, etc
-- end repeated for each section/page --
* Test website functionality
* Host on github
* Post to LinkedIn
* Add to resume
* Bask in the glory of project completion (whatever form that might take)

### Inspiration
* I was inspired to do this project by [Pelagia Majoni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pmajoni/). Her [website](https://pmajon.github.io/i/) was created using pure HTML and CSS and that is something that I thought was within my scope of abilities. Before seeing her post in LinkedIn, I had been pondering web development for the purpose of getting a website in time for recruitment season, but I never found myself with enough time to learn the full stack of web technologies, nor did I want to spend a lot of time or money on this project when I needed that time to work on my problem solving, OOP, and technical interview skills as well as other robotics and CS projects in the pipeline. With the free hosting in github, and some time dedicated to learning HTML and CSS, I think the final product will be a nice one.

Other resoruces will be updated as I get further in the project.
