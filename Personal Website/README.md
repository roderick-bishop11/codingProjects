# Personal website project (try #2) 

## Project overview

This project is a self-led foray into the web-dev territory. My University does not offer courses on this topic currently but I still wanted to build a website, at least a static one
for the purposes of putting it on a business card and having another project under my belt. This project is bound to be a rough one, but I am certainly open to any comments or advice that
you guys have. Explore the repo, and let's hope I can do this right!

## Project steps
I thought it would be a great idea to plan out this project and break it down to smaller, easily doable steps: 

* Complete some research on easy websites for V1 of website. Things like technology stacks, architecture, beginner website examples, hosting, etc 
* Develop a few designs (paper drawings)
* Choose the design that best shows off your personality and will force you to learn to complete it 
* Create README outlining the overall goal of the project 
* Plan out the steps for the project (<-- we are here)
* Further develop design using design software. Indlude fonts, colors, assets, and possible animation details (hover, click, etc)
* Write out complete text for each web page in a document
* Mull over text on the document and refine
* Refresh HTML basics(tags, refs, divs, containers, links/buttons)
* Learn more advanced HTML concepts (are these even a thing)
* Implement functional menu bar and footer to website
* Add text to respective pages in HTML(all pages)
-- repeated for each section/page --
* Add all hrefs to assets in HTML
* Make sure that all text is in proper divs/containers/spans for use with CSS
* Refresh on CSS basics
* Learn some more advanced CSS design concepts/implementations
* Organize all text on the page according to the design
* Add font colors to all text
* Add background colors
* Add animations to assets, text, etc
-- end repeated for each section/page --
* Test website functionality
* Host on github
* Post to LinkedIn
* Add to resume
* Bask in the glory of project completion (whatever form that might take)
