# __We Vote__ - the political accountability and acessibility app for the people.

This was our 2020 hackathon project at CU Hackit 2020 at Clemson University. 


# The problem
* High barriers to entry when voting- registration, presenting cards at booth & adequate knowledge to vote.
* No unified system for updates or elected official accountability.
* There is no way to know if you are being heard by your officials. 


# The vision
* An interactive and eco friendly app 
* Access to universal registration
* Update and educate voters
* Keep elected officials accountable
* Provide a platform for citizens to express concerns
* Common FAQ's answered


# How does this help
* Provides an interface for citizens to express concerns to public officials & learn about what they are doing.
* Connects voters to credible and reliable news sources based on selected locale.
* Reduces the barrier to entry to voting by providing easy way to register to vote and change information.


# Possible Poblems that will have to be addressed in a full product
- [x] Security - There is no regulation around this type of mobile app and how could this amalgamation of data raise secutiry risks.
- [x] Navigation- UX navigation and precincts
- [x] Limited options - you can't feasibly raise any concern at any time through the app. Some users might find that too limiting.
- [x] Maintenance 
- [x] Compiling news sources

# Next Steps
* Create a data-driven dashboard for our elected officials to see that summarizes and gives insights to the needs of the people in a concise way. 
* Add API functionality or website redirection to news outlets for each locale the user chooses (city, state, national). 
* Employ location services to help users find precincts and events.
* Securely connect with state election databased to easily update address and receive new voter registration cards instantly.

# Learnings
* UI design in XCode. 
* How to effectively plan out for a build using design thinking strategies. 
* How to work with Swift, Api's, views & elements, and responsive design.
