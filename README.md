#Hi Guys!#


This is the unofficial README for my personal website. I'm starting the learning process for this project in soon,
but the actual start of this project won't really be until later, possibly 2021. The goal is to get this website up and running by recruiting season 2021 so that I can haev a great recruiting season. So far, I have some basic designs and implementation ideas but stay tuned for the realization of them! In the meantime, check out the <a href="https://github.com/roderick-bishop11/roboticsprojects">RoboticsProjects</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/roderick-bishop11/CodingPractice">CodingPractice</a> repos for more updated activity.

This README will also be updated with logged updates to the website going forward.

##Thanks!##
