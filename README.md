# THE PROJECTS REPO! #



This repository is full of larger coding projects that I have done on my own or with a group. This repo will feature projects coded in multiple languages, but will take a little longer to complete and update than the smaller programs located in the codingPractice repo. Check back for updates and new commits. In the meantime, check out the [RoboticsProjects](https://github.com/roderick-bishop11/roboticsprojects), or [CodingPractice](https://github.com/roderick-bishop11/CodingPractice) repos for more updated activity. 

## Updates
* *8/8/2020*:
Added CUHackit 2020 Project, WeVote. This is a project that I plan to continue either by myself or with my group using the knowledge learned either from self-led learning or from the CodePath IOS Dev Course that I applied for with tipIt! as part of the application. View WeVote [here](https://github.com/roderick-bishop11/projects/tree/master/CUHackit2020)
* *8/2/2020*:
Added tipIt! Project to repo. This project was done as a pre-work assignment for CodePath's IOS development course. Check that out [here](https://github.com/roderick-bishop11/projects/tree/master/tipIt!)
