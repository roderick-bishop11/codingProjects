# Hi Guys!


This repository is full of larger coding projects that I have done on my own or with a group in a classroom setting. This repo will feature projects coded in multiple languages, but will take a little longer to complete and update than the smaller programs located in the codingSamples repo. Please check back often for updates and new commits In the meantime, check out the <a href="https://github.com/roderick-bishop11/roboticsprojects">RoboticsProjects</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/roderick-bishop11/CodingPractice">CodingPractice</a> repos for more updated activity.
