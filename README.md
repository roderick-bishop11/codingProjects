# Welcome to the coding projects repository!
This repository is full of larger coding projects that I have done on my own, with a group in a classroom setting, or at an event. This repo will feature projects coded in multiple languages, but will take a little longer to complete and update than the smaller programs located in the [codingSamples](https://github.com/roderick-bishop11/codingSamples) repo. Please check back often for updates and new commits


# Goal
The general idea of this repo as opposed to the [codingSamples](https://github.com/roderick-bishop11/codingSamples) is to show of the *application* of the skills/concepts that I have learned in class. Thus, this repo will be updated less often. 


# Who Is This Repository For?
This repo is mainly for potential employers. Simply put, they need to see that I can apply my knowledge to provide real world solutions. 

TL;DR
=== 
**This is my codingProjects repo, I hope you enjoy**
